# calculator
A simple c++ console calculator I wrote in a few days. There's nothing special about this program, I just didi it to learn more about parsing a string of mathematical operations and evaluating it.

# usage
example: calc "sin(Ï€ / 2) + 5.3^3 - (5 + (0.3 - 2))"

You should be able to clone/download this repo and build the program and run it on your device.
